# Assignment 1 in ADTS2310 - Software Testing

This assignment is a submission in Software Testing.
## Task description
You are working as a test automation engineer in a software development team. For the past few weeks, the team has been hard at work, developing a banking portal solution for ParaBank. Now, the website is in QA stage. The team understands that you have been learning playwright and has therefore presented this opportunity for you to create test cases and practice your automation skills using the framework

The goal of this task is to write some test cases and implement them in a new test suite. The new test
suite should be set up in such a way that all tests begin with logging in and end with logging out. This is
to ensure that all tests can run independently. One benefit here is that we could setup the tests to run in
parallel, which would make the tests run faster.
